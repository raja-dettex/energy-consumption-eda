# Global Energy Generation and Consumption Analysis (1997-2017)

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze global energy generation and consumption patterns from 1997 to 2017, with a focus on OECD and BRICS regions. It employs data analysis and machine learning methodologies to identify trends, disparities, and the dominance of various energy sources. The insights derived will help formulate effective energy policies and strategies.

## Problem Statement
Energy consumption and generation patterns vary significantly across regions due to economic, industrial, and resource-related factors. Existing global energy data often have inconsistencies, missing values, and integration challenges. This project addresses these issues by cleaning and analyzing data to provide a comprehensive overview of energy trends, emphasizing OECD, BRICS, and continental variations.

## Objectives
### 1. Data Analysis (1997-2017)
- Examine energy generation data (TWH) across continents and countries.
- Analyze energy consumption patterns in OECD and BRICS regions.
- Investigate renewable vs. non-renewable energy generation.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Organization
- Handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- Structure data for integration and analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify key trends in energy generation and consumption.
- Integrate renewable and non-renewable energy datasets.

### 4. Machine Learning Analysis
- Feature selection and engineering.
- Classification and regression modeling.
- Predictive analysis of future energy trends.

### 5. Policy Recommendations
- Suggest data-driven strategies to optimize energy use.
- Assess potential impact on sustainability goals.

### 6. Stakeholder Engagement
- Share findings with policymakers, industry leaders, and the public.
- Develop educational resources to raise awareness.

## Data Sources
- Kaggle Dataset: [Renewable Power Generation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jamesvandenberg/renewable-power-generation/)

## Key Features of the Dataset
- **Location:** Geographic and regional identifiers.
- **Energy Type:** Renewable (solar, wind, hydro) vs. non-renewable (coal, gas, nuclear).
- **Generation & Consumption:** Energy in terawatt-hours (TWH).
- **Time:** Year of data collection.
- **Economic Indicators:** GDP, industrial output.
- **Environmental Impact:** Carbon emissions and ecological impact.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python:** Data cleaning, analysis, visualization (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Documentation and visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning models.

## Hypothesis
- OECD and BRICS regions exhibit distinct energy consumption trends.
- Renewable energy adoption varies by region due to technology and resource availability.
- Developed regions (Europe, North America) have higher energy consumption than developing regions (Africa, Middle East, Pacific, CIS).

## Methodology
### 1. Data Collection
- Compile energy generation and consumption data.
- Integrate economic and environmental indicators.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handle missing values, standardize formats, and integrate datasets.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics, trend analysis, and visualizations.
- Comparative analysis of OECD, BRICS, and other regions.

### 4. Machine Learning Analysis
- Feature selection and engineering.
- Apply and compare classification/regression models.
- Predict future energy generation and consumption trends.

### 5. Solution Development
- Propose strategies for optimizing energy consumption.
- Provide policy recommendations for sustainability.

### 6. Reporting and Presentation
- Generate reports, dashboards, and policy briefs.
- Organize workshops to engage stakeholders.

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Comprehensive Analysis:** Trends, disparities, and energy consumption patterns over time.
2. **Predictive Models:** Forecast future energy generation and consumption.
3. **Actionable Solutions:** Data-driven energy optimization strategies.
4. **Impact Assessment:** Evaluating sustainability and policy effects.
5. **Awareness and Engagement:** Educating stakeholders on global energy trends.
